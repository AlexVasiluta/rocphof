# Romanian Competitive Programming Hall of Fame

A place where you can neatly see all the results in the National Olympiad in Informatics from Romania starting from 2015 (for now), grouped by contest, contestant or place. 
Inspired by [cphof](https://cphof.org/) and [IOI stats](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/).
